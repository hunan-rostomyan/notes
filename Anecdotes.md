### Stewart, I.

- "A certain theoretical physicist secured himself a mighty reputation on the basis of his deduction,
on very general mathematical grounds, of a formula for the radius of the universe. It was a very
impressive formula, liberally spattered with *e*s, *c*s, *h*s, and a few *π*s and *√*s for good measure.
Being a theoretician, he never bothered to work it out numerically. It was several years before anybody
had enough curiosity to substitute the numbers in it and work out the answer. Ten centimetres."
