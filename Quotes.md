### Arnold

- "In my view, mathematics and physics are parts of the same experimental science. When the experiments cost billions of dollars we call this science physics. When they are cheap, we call it mathematics. Furthermore, mathematics is a unified whole that must not be divided into algebra, geometry, etc."
  - unity of mathematics; experiments and mathematics
  - *Lectures and Problems*, p. 4

### Coelho

- "The world is changed by your example, not by your opinion."
  - teaching by example

### Descartes

- "You just keep pushing. You just keep pushing. I made every mistake that could be made. But I just kept pushing."
  - perseverance; hard work; making mistakes

### Feynman

- "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself â€” and you are the easiest person to fool."
  - being honest with yourself

### Maslow

- "I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail."
  - problem solving; law of the instrument

### Savvateev, A.

- "That you've got questions is already good. It happens that you neither understand something nor can ask questions about what you don't understand. Sometimes you don't understand something but it's clear what you don't understand. This latter sort of stage is 90% of understanding. Because if you can formulate what you don't understand then I'll immediately explain."
  - understanding; asking questions; higher-order knowledge

### Stewart, I.

- "...logic is not all. No formula ever *suggested* anything on its own. Logic can be used to solve problems, but it canot suggest which problems to try. No one has ever formalized *significance*. To recognize what is significant you need a certain amount of experience, plus that elusive quality: *intuition*."
  - logic; intuition; psychology of discovery; logic of justification
  - *Concepts of Modern Mathematics*, p. 4

- "Practically everybody possesses some degree of mathematical intuition. [...] The main object in training mathematicians should be to develop their intuition into a controllable tool."
  - intuition; objective of mathematical training; math education
  - *Concepts of Modern Mathematics*, p. 4

- "Many pages have been expended on polemics in favor of rigour over intuition, or of intuition over rigour. Both extremes miss the point: the power of mathematics lies precisely in the combination of intuition *and* rigour. Controlled genius, inspired logic. We all know the brilliant person whose ideas never quite work, and the tidy, organized person who never achieves anything worthwhile because he is too busy getting tidy and organized. These are the extremes to avoid."
  - intuition; rigor; controlled genius; inspired logic; avoiding extremes
  - *Concepts of Modern Mathematics*, p. 4

- "In learning mathematics, the psychological is more important than the logical. I have seen superbly logical lectures which none of the audience understood. Intuition should take precedence; it can be backed up by formal proof later. An intuitive proof allows you to understand *why* the theorem must be true; the logic merely provides firm grounds to show that it *is* true. 

    In subsequent chapters, I have tried to stress the intuitive side of mathematics. Instead of giving formal proofs I have tried to sketch the underlying ideas.
In a proper textbook one should, ideally, do both; few texts achieve this ideal. 

    Some mathematicians, perhaps 10 per cent, think in formulae. Their intuition deals in formulae. But the rest think in pictures; their intuition is geometrical. Pictures carry so much more information than words. For many years schoolchildren were discouraged from drawing pictures because "they aren't rigorous". This was a bad mistake. Pictures are not rigorous, it is true, but they are an essential aid to thought and no one should reject anything that can help them to think better."
