A list of resources for studying various things. Mostly in English and Russian.

*Note.* I've kept the references simple; for the details, consult the [Bibliography](https://github.com/hunan-rostomyan/notes/blob/master/Bibliography.md).


# Group theory

Alexandroff, P. (2012) *An Introduction to the Theory of Groups*
- tags: group theory; algebra



# History of Mathematics

Yaglom, I.M. (2009) Geometries, Groups and Algebras in the 19th century
- tags: history of geometries; history algebras; history of mathematics
- opinion: this is a marvelous book, full of interesting historical, biographical, and occasionally formal details. It's unfortunate that a lot of the
greats had tragic ends (duels, poverty, depression, loneliness). It's disappointing that Gauss, despite being a genius, was unable or unwilling to
recognize and encourage other geniuses. There are stories of geometries and algebras in this book, but above all else, there are
stories of imperfect people trying to make sense of nature.



# Linear Algebra

Cherney et al. [Linear Algebra](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~linear/)
